The Eightfold Nature of Profundity

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Concerning the eight aspects of the profound nature of reality (dharmatā), the Ornament says:

Profundity is due to arising and ceasing,Suchness and the knowable,Knowing, activity, non-duality,And
skill in means.[1]

Without relying on these profundities it is difficult to attain awakening, so there is profundity
of interdependence. Profundity through cessation means that merely by virtue of the
mind’s having arisen it is oriented towards cessation, and therefore has the nature of profundity
through ceasing. The profundity of suchness is the non-conceptual domain, the genuine
nature of phenomena, suchness, just as it is. The profundity of the knowable is the mind
that is none other than suchness. The profundity of knowing is the non-seeing of suchness
by means of suchness. The profundity of activity means non-activity, since it is by not
acting at all that one who abides by the perfection of wisdom trains in the profound transcendent
perfection of wisdom. The profundity of non-duality refers to non-dual engagement
with ultimate activity and the bodhisattva’s non-engagement with the conditioning factors
of signs and the signless. The profundity of skill in means refers to the fact that when
the ten strengths and so on up to the eighteen unshared attributes of a buddha are not perfected,
there is no unsurpassable enlightenment to be attained, and therefore skill in means
prevents any real or as unreal activity. Moreover, by knowing that the characteristic of
all phenomena is emptiness, one becomes skilled in adversity, introducing beings who are
caught up in it to its remedy, and ripening sentient beings.
